Impact page

Fix the filters to be responsive in dark mode. At the bottom, let the projects show correctly at the bottom area in a similar design, but also fix the dark mode for the category on the projects cards there.

After the hero section, do some padding to the statistics to leave some space at the top, and also consider reducing the rounded cards for each statistics as it looks big for no reason. Animate the countdown too.


⦁	Missing connection of the annual report button connection to the dashboard as well as methodology buttons in the same page. Something worth considering.

Programmes Page

The cards need to be uniform and not overly rounded in the corners, a border rounding of 8 or 7 (All cards including the projects page, articles etc.) is okay for the programmes cards.
No need to have emojis on the programmes cards as there is an image for that.
Among the card features i think it will be good if we have the partners as they appear in the list of partners page to appear there in the pecking order so it shows on the cards how many partners are in that program, and when a single one is clicked, it shows such info on the sidebar too as well as the region or country/s where that program is running.

The support programme button to be redirecting users to the donation page.

Do away with that project lead card within the individual programmes, it makes no sense there, and that should instead be replaced with the organizations supporting the programme. 

Most of these have been very well implemented, but just double check to ensure everything is good. 


For individual programmes too, ensure when they are opened the header and footer of the website remain consistent as other pages, that needs to be fixed.



Projects Page

Check and ensure that the projects page is correctly working, such that the new project addition is working correctly within the dashboard.

There is also missing info regarding the individual projects that need to be captured. Including the project's photo gallery, key objectives of the project (sidebar), Voices from the field (testimonials slider), Donation towards the project, countries where the project is taking place/regions if it is one country.

These updates need to be done to the projects page in the dashboard as well as the template, if the features are missing.
For individual projects too, ensure when they are opened the header and footer of the website remain consistent as other pages.



Media/News Page

Dark mode needs to be responsive enough as other pages do.

The design for the filters as well as the search should be properly designed and aligned to look good and professional.
Verify that an article can be published and be visible in the articles public page.

There are 5 articles already written that have been captured in the documentation, just copy the text of each article and publish as provided there.

Check to also ensure every single article opened obeys the website design, with a header and footer consistent.



Media Gallery Page(Dialogue box)

For the photos that need to be added anywhere, the dialogue box showing what has been selected should show correctly on the left info about the photo including the sections where important info like alt text area, caption area, image name, and image URL. As things like articles need to show caption of the image in the article for seo importance.
 This is not just for the images, but all materials uploaded into the gallery page. The dialogue to be scrollable on the side when an image is selected.


Resources Page

Look at the public design. It is missing from the dashboard sidebar menu. Materials on research, reports etc. to be largely uploaded from there and visible for downloads. Ensure the dark mode responsiveness is also okay. Proper design for the filters over there is also very welcome, not forgetting to add the filter categories within the dashboard too, including new categories in future for the resources.

Anywhere there is a download option, ensure that it works as intended. 


Team Members Page

For the team members page in the dashboard, the implementation is missing. It is supposed to have the function to update the /team page with members image(uniformly scaled for consistency), their role, and when clicked, a little bio about them as well as social media handles.


Accreditations Page

The accreditation for the organization are supposed to be managed and updated in this page. Details about the accreditations are supposed to be captured within this area, all of them as they already appear in the public page. 


**Anywhere that needs an image upload or logo is connected to the main media gallery page, to avoid duplication and for easy management. **

For this, come up with a comprehensive plan for all the issues pointed out, break it down into small tasks and start working on them. Do not leave out anything untouched. These are the final touches.
