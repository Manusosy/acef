## Production Deployment

### Regular Update Process (via Terminal)

To pull the latest changes and ensure everything is clean and optimized:
```bash
cd ~/acef-app

```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/main

# 2. Update dependencies
composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
npm install

# 3. Build assets for production
npm run build

# 4. Clear and rebuild cache (Crucial for Config/Middleware changes)
php artisan optimize
php artisan view:clear
php artisan cache:clear

# 5. Run migrations (if any)
php artisan migrate --force
```

### Deployment Checklist for Production Security
- Ensure `APP_ENV=production` is set in your `.env` file.
- The `SecurityHeaders` middleware and HTTPS enforcement in `AppServiceProvider` will **automatically activate** once the `public/hot` file is removed (which happens after `npm run build` when you stop the dev server).
- **IMPORTANT**: If assets or styling appear broken after deployment, double check that your `public/build` directory contains the latest manifest and assets generated by `npm run build`.

## cPanel Deployment (Specific Steps)

If you are using a shared hosting environment like cPanel, follow these steps:

1. **SSH into your server**.
2. **Navigate to the app root** (e.g., `cd ~/acef-app`).
3. **Run the update process** described above.
4. **Symlink or Copy Build Assets**:
   ```bash
   rm -f ~/public_html/hot
   cp -rv ~/acef-app/public/build ~/public_html/
   ```
